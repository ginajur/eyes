# Moving Eyes Exercise 👀
This assignment was an exercise in using Javascript in combination with CSS. Both eyes are designed to follow the cursor as it navigates across the screen.

Developed as part of an assignment with the MiT full stack coding certification. 

# How to run 🤓

This file can run locally from the index.html file, eyes.js and styles.css files. Store all files in one file location. 

# Roadmap of future improvements 🗺️ 

In the future I would like to add more features to the face, and change some of the colors.
